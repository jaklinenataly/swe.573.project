				Do you know that it is possible to use your Twitter account to sell
				your unused belongings. Yes you can, but there is a significant
				problem when you want to sell and buy something on Twitter, that is

				Sure you consider that there is an option to pay at the door, but it
				is not useful for international sales. You cannot expect from
				someone abroad to accept the payment on behalf of you, right!. A
				trusted, secure, and automated payment mechanism is needed. Let's
				recognize you the <b>wolower</b>.
